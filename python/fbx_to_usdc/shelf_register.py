"""
shelf_register.py - registers this tool's button into the shared "CGA Tools"
shelf, creating the shelf if it doesn't exist yet. Idempotent: safe to run on
every Houdini startup. Multiple tools can share the same shelf without clobbering
each other.

Same pattern as the Prop Material Creator / Character Material Tool - only
TOOL_NAME, TOOL_LABEL, TOOL_SCRIPT and TOOL_ICON differ.
